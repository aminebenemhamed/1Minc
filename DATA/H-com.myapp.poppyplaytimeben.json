		"name": "Poppy Playtime! By Mikevalla20",
		"description": "This version’s graphics are probably most like the original game, and are probably best overall. The difference is that it’s not as complex as the original. There aren’t really any puzzles to solve, and there isn’t much physical interaction. In this version you wonder around the map finding keys to get into certain doors/pathways. Eventually you get to the part where Huggy Wuggy chases you, but the maze is a lot simpler. Just like in the original, you get to the red poppy, and go through to find the Poppy Playtime doll in her case. Once you click on her, the game ends.",

		"description": "Another popular version is “Poppy Playtime” by DanzeeyNicky. This version’s graphics are a lot simpler, but still very similar to the original. There is a little more interaction with this one, but still not really any puzzles to solve. Unlike the first version, this version actually has the GrabPack, but you can’t really use it on anything. Again, you wonder throughout the map to eventually find the red poppy flower. In this game Huggy Wuggy can kill you if he catches up to you, but it’s easy to stay away from him. Once you get to the poppy flower, you go through to find the Poppy doll just like in the first version. Nothing happens after you get to her though.",

		"description": "The third best version out as of now is called “Poppy Playtime” by RIP_HEROBRINE. This version has the simplest graphics out of all of them, but again, still looks very similar to the original. You can interact with more items around the map in this game, unlike the others. You can pick up the tapes and put them into the players. This version also has the GrabPack, and it works somewhat, but not entirely. You can only get so far in this version though, unfortunately. We tried it out, and couldn’t get past a door that you need the GrabPack to open. It was a bit glitchy, and so that was as far as we went.",
